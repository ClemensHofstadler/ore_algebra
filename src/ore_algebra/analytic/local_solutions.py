    Specify the sorting order for local solutions.

    Roughly speaking, they are sorted in decreasing order of asymptotic
    dominance: when two solutions are asymptotically comparable, the largest
    one as x â†’ 0 comes first. In addition, divergent solutions, including
    things like `x^i`, always come before convergent ones.
